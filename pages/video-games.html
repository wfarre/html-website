              I am a great fan of Final Fantasy, so when I learned about they will mix the universe of Final Fantasy and
              the one of Disney, I thought: "this will never work, it's stupid". BUT, I am curious, I decided to give it
              a chance and within 5 days, I finished it, I loved it. The gameplay was classic and original in the same
              time. The scenario was interesting enough, and less complicated that the rest of the saga. And what a
              pleasure to revisit the Disney movies as one of the main characters.

            <p>I am more Japanese Role Playing Gamer, but Baldur's Gate III is such an incredible experience. I have
              always dreamt about playing Dungeons and Dragons, so this a great opportunity. I played the first one a
              little bit a long time ago, but I think the third one is a total success: it is beautiful, the
              story-telling is incredible. And about the story-telling, which is the strength of the game, is so crazy:
              you have so much freedom in the game, so you really feel that you are playing and not watching an
              interactive movie. This is one of my problem with the recent games, there is still some challenge, but you
              don't feel as player, you are THAT important, and I feel BG3 put the player back to the center of the
              game.

              I can't talk video games without talking a Naughty Dog's game. The Last of Us, part II, was disturbing and
              put myself in a little bit uncomfortable position. The story was great and very interesting, making you
              questionning about what/who is good, what/who is bad.
