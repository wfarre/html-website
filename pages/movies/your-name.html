                <h3>Story:</h3>
                <p>Mitsuha lives in the countryside and dreams about going to Tokyo and Taki is yound boy who lives in
                    Tokyo. One day, they wake up and find themselves in the other one's body. They will learn about each
                    other to avoid causing any trouble.</p>

                <h3>What I like:</h3>
                <p>I don't think it's the Japanese animation, but I think it was quite revolutionary. The animation was
                    so incredible. Then, the story is a teenage love sotry, but the angle was quite interesting.</p>
