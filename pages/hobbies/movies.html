                    I love watching movies! That's one of my hobbies which hasn't changed since my childhood. Now, there
                    are plenty of way to watch movies such as streaming or blue-ray, but nothing can compete with
                    watching movies in a movie
                    theater. I think going to the movie theater is the best to enjoy movies: the screen, the sound and
                    also, the public -if it is a good public.

                    I love movies because as for most of the people with books, it is a way to escape the reality, to
                    dream about another reality. I don't have a preferred genre of movies: comedy, romance,
                    science-fiction, action, adventure... every type of movie is interesting.
