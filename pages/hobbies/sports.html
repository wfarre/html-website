                    <p>I put yoga in the first position, because it is the sport I really practice everyday. I have been
                        practicing yoga for few years, mainly on my own, but when I have the opportunity,
                        I try
                        to practice with other people and a teacher.</p>
                    <p>What I like about yoga is despite its relaxing property, yoga is a good way challenge yourself
                        physically and mentally. Spoiler alert: every pose is not always easy. Also, I think yoga is
                        adapted/ could be adapted to everyone at every age.

                    <p>
                        I started martial arts with judo as a lot of kids, then I praticed a lot of different martial
                        arts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I do have a preference for Japanese martial arts: I like the ritual, the discipline, the
                        clothes...
                        And one of my favorite martial arts is Aikido: I like the movement and the philosophy behind it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, recently I discovered (and finally tried) Taichichuan, which was my dream to learn
                        learn
                        and practice it, and I
                        do
                        love it. The good thing is as yoga, I can continue practicing even if I get older. As yoga,
                        Taichichuan could
                        be
                        also challenging: the movements are very slow, so you have to learn to control your body, your
                        balance and your core. It is
                        like meditation in movement.

                    <p>Nobody likes running...</p>
                    <p>
                        That is what I thought as well, I still think so in a way. When I was a kid, I
                        very slow -sluggish- and I was lacking of stamina. However, as an adult, I rediscovered running
                        (I am
                        still slow and lacking of stamina), it is still a pain in the neck, but I kind of like it now. I
                        like to push my limits and
                        after the exercise, I feel soooo good.
