        <p>I love learning languages, even though it is difficult to keep yourself motivated, especially when you learn
          by yourself. It has been big
          part of my life as I majored in Japanese and English at university (and now, I am learning programming
          languages).</p>
        <p>Even though nowadays, we can use AI to translate instantly in the language of your choice, I do think
          learning a
          language remains important. First, learning new skills is important and fun. Then, it is a good way to learn
          more about the culture ( I started learning Japanese because I was passionate about the culture). To finish, I
          think
          interacting and communicating directly with the locals is the best way to immerse yourself in the culture and
          the customs of the country when you travel.</p>
