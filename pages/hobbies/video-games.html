        <p>Here is a hobby, I can't forget, as movies, I think playing video games is/was my most important hobby. "was"
          because I don't have as much
          time as I used to 😢, but "is" because there are still excellent games I can binge play. Recently, I found
          myself
          really enjoying playing Baldur's Gate III.</p>
        <p>My favorite types of games are Role Playing Game, especially Japanese Role Playing Game, adventure and
          platform.</p>
        <p>Playing video games is a good way to practice problem solving skills, to challenge myself and furthermost
          escape my day-to-day routine.</p>
