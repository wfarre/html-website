                    I do enjoy taking pictures especially with a proper camera. I don't really like shooting with a
                    smartphone. It isn't a snobbish thing -maybe a little-, but I really enjoy shooting with a
                    viewfinder, I like the object itself (I am a geek) and I do think you have more control with a
                    proper camera (even though smartphones are getting better and better). Now, I own a fujifilm camera,
                    and it is such a loveable camera: retro style with a lot of dials... üòç </p>
                <p>However, recently, I have less time to practice this skill and hobby. I try to practice it by
                    taking pictures of my son. I really do enjoy/miss wandering on the street with
                    my camera: sometimes I shoot, sometimes I don't. To me, it is kind of lonely hobby, if I am with
                    other people, I feel sorry if I make them stop to take a picture.
